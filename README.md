# Project-Euler

Solutions to the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems written in Python 3 (for now). I will be adding solutions as I solve the problems. These are by no means the most efficient algorithims or the best way of solving these problems, just my humble attempts.

# What is Project Euler?

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.  

The motivation for starting Project Euler, and its continuation, is to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
